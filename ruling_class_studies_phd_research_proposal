# Ruling Class Studies
**Phd research proposal**

*by Nenad Romić aka Marcell Mars*


## Introduction

The computer digital networks are today's essential communication infrastructure which are result of successful transformation of abstractions like automation, administration, control and computation. It has power to challenge every field not yet transformed and during the transition it empowers ones who are masters of the means of transformation. Most of the time it empowers computer industry, military and government, but all along the history of computer technologies it provided temporary autonomous demilitarized zones for hobbyists, enthusiasts, hackers and communities who were knowledgeable enough to build their own tools and infrastructures.

For years, I was only part of digital counter-cultural, producer, curator, new media artist, advocate or developer of free software. The raise of giant corporate infrastructures everybody depends on motivated me to start with research: Ruling Class Studies.

**Ruling Class Studies** is a research of the latest state of the art in innovation,  adaptation, and intelligence in capitalism that looks closely at the sociopolitical context of  digital natives of internet business: *Google*,  *Facebook*, *Amazon* and *eBay* (***GFAeB***).

In this research I am primarily interested in a relationship between commons based peer production of free software, crowd based volunteering work, ***GFAeB*** production, and the related extraction of value. Their dominant position in provision of some of the most important infrastructures od today produced dependency (on them and their infrastructures) that require radical rethinking of political, economic, and legal regulations from the perspective of public, private and business sector, as well as the very concepts of autonomy and freedom from the perspective of the digital counter-culture.  

My goal, with **Ruling Class Studies**, is to produce critical theoretical instruments to measure the political, ethical and professional accountability of ***GFAeB*** to their proclaimed missions, advertised practices, and to a world where their monopolies are taking root. I analyze their business strategies, visions, corporate missions especially considering the way these firms design technical infrastructure, create rules governing users' access to data and services, and appropriate counter-cultural values and identities.

After three years of a research I have clear idea of what type of interdisciplinary collaboration is needed in order for this research to develop further, as well as, what would be the three main conceptual frameworks of the ***Ruling Class Studies***. 

I would like to focus on these three intertwined concepts: **infrastructure**, **abstraction** and **autonomy**.


## Infrastructure.


All of the corporate giants of digital networks while reaching the network effect incrementally developed their infrastructures to the level at which very few competitors can even imagine to fight. GFAeB were founded as Internet only businesses. They are the digital natives of the business world.

The network services they build are offered to the world very often free of charge, a promise typically enacted by governments. Their huge growth has demonstrated the strength of the network paradigm. Many hoped that digital networks would eliminate intermediaries completely, but although many disappeared, these few who remained found their position strengthened.

I'm interested in identifying the changes in business strategy fostered by the network form prior to digitalization, and distinguishing what is new in the behavior of GFAeB. I would like to explore how companies from the past invested profits in search of fields into which to expand. Furthermore, I will make a comparative analysis with older firms who have used networks as both an infrastructure and a utility. Particularly, the mail order catalog business of Sears, Roebuck and Co., technological and business innovation in electric power generation/grids (e.g. Chicago Edison), and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company.

An additional interest lies in researching the government's policies which address both problems of established monopolies or the failures of markets in bringing the infrastructures up to the need of expected growth and development (e.g. nationalization of the grid in Great Britain by The Electricity Act 1947).

My research at MediaLab Prado for Visualizar 11: Understanding Infrastructures should provide solid base for future collaborations with computer science and engineering departments in measuring the scope and scale of corporate infrastructures. Using the open source project Hadoop as loose equivalent of Google's web search infrastructures together with processing the data with SLOC tools I came up with the numbers of $1B, 1K programmers and 12 years of development if one would start to develop Google's web search software stack in 2011. Still, if one would copy the Google's attempts it will build on top of free software (common based peer production) which already covers around 70% of the resources needed.

## Abstraction.

There are two terms which have surprisingly peculiar trajectory in computer world: abstraction and utopia (see in Autonomy.).

The principle of abstraction in software engineering is a fundamental gesture by which the duplication of the same code is avoided but also by which one enable herself for operating at the higher layer of complexity. As McKenzie Wark puts it in Hacker Manifesto:

> Everywhere abstraction reigns, abstraction made concrete.

Turing universal machine became objet petit a of my research. In Tracing Concepts (attached to this application), published in Volume #28 - Internet of things, I wrote about the history of virtual machines  unwrapping the foundation of - virtualization - today's main concept behind running distributed network of computers as utility. 

I would like to expand this area of research into explaining importance of  concepts like Map/Reduce (Google's model for processing large data sets), service-oriented-architecture which led to recent software-as-a-service (Amazon's Web Services infrastructure). The developments of distributed computer infrastructures could lead to the shift of paradigm from personal computers (which allowed GFAeB to scale up incrementally) to domain specific hardware and software which, if it happens, will be controlled by very few actors.

Furthermore, I would like to explore the trajectory of the idea of computation machine which goes from library and business catalogs, to bureaucracy, administration and government (as a machine).

These, rather kittlerian, (historical continuity) narratives and vocabulary are essential for understanding the new mode of social production facilitated by new capitalist imperatives and which has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between play, consumption and production, life and work, labor and non-labor.

## Autonomy.

The utopian fantasy in the computer world is best described with another of its abstractions: separation of concerns. It is the design principle coined by Edsger Dijkstra in his 1974 paper “On The Role of Scientific Thought”:

> [The separation of concerns] is what I mean by focusing one's
> attention upon some aspect: it does not mean ignoring the other
> aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's
> point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and
> multiple-track minded simultaneously.

 

A complex system designed by the principle of separation of concerns allows distributed and modular structure. Another trend in computer world is that every module, a component of the system, through time tends to improve itself to the Turing completeness (a conceptual equivalent of Turing universal machine). That means that inside of the complex system its part becomes able to recreate the system itself. A commitment to ultimately distribute, separate concerns, secure/encrypt communication and eventually build distributed infrastructure of common based peer production, collaboration and trust is the reason why we have Free Software Movement, GNU/Linux, PGP, Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Wikileaks, Bitcoin, Tor, Anonymous and at last Internet.

GFAeB, especially Google and Facebook, have complex relationship with the progressive tech communities. GFAeB are state of the art of the field of computer technology developed out of engineering, business and the military, and have been characterized by a versatile group of experts, amateurs, hackers and counter-cultural enthusiasts. Their struggle for the autonomy is usually based on the same principles: ultimately distribute, separate concerns and secure communication but what is reached stays inside of the corporate wall gardens and in context of empowerment of future technological development (not end use!) it appears to the world just as close as the old mainframes of IBM (before personal computers).


## Methodology and output.

If the Control Revolution began, as James Beniger wrote about, in the last decades of XIX century as the crisis of control of information generated by industrial revolution in the fields of transportation, production, distribution and consumption, GFAeB are probably paradigmatic example of a beginning of the end of that cycle. In order to understand, analyze and manage these complexities we need to build tools to measure and describe their scope and scale of operation (something I hope I am on the right track with my Visualizar 11 research), understand the ways they extract value (while being free of charge for the end users), and how they transform resources into utilities, recognize their dreams, motivations and fantasies, and finally anticipate when their move from innovation and optimization enters and generates the structural crisis (as Immanuel Wallerstein explains the best).
